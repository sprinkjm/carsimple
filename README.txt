Use this repository to simulate the output of a car-like robot. 

The repository includes several models:
(1) a more complex kinematic model with steering rate inputs
(2) a simple kinematic model similar to Dubins

model1.m and model2.m provide input/output as matlab functions.

simulink_exexecution provides a graphical example with two different inputs.
